       |       |       | When ssh'd, put remote host name in status line?
       |       |       |     Although, maybe not. If remote is running tmux, it will have a status line of its own.
       |       |       | Turn on/off logging  (see pipe-pane command)
       |       |       | Use clipboard buffers effectively, including with external programs in the GUI

To Do:
 * x ^a @  Interactive joine-pane
   * x http://superuser.com/questions/470130/tmux-prompt-to-select-window-for-join-pane-while-still-seeing-window-numbers-an
 * choose-buffer
   * x ^a C list buffers, select one to copy to X clip board
     * and to default buffer, so can paste with ]
       No. Can't find a way to push the buffer stack other than copy mode, boo!
   * x ^a =  list buffers, select one to paste immediately (This is a default binding, heh)
   * x ^a >  list buffers, select one to save to file
     * (prompt for filename) - No. Since all commands of a key binding are run in
       parallel, I couldn't make it first select a buffer, then prompt for filename :(
   * x ^a <  Load buffer #0 with contents of /tmp/tmux-exchange, and paste it immediately
 * environment
   * x Propagate DISPLAY variable
   * x Get ssh agent working on remote session?
   * x tmuxenv: zsh function to manually reload env
   * zsh auto-reload periodic?
 * x Improve status window notifications/color
   * x change active from red to bright white
   * x Make shell error prompt turn it red?
   * x Make normal shell prompt and/or inactivity do something, as clue command is done (turn yellow)
   * x Clear the above two when select the window
   * Status bar tips (?): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9628435/tmux-status-bar-configuration
 * What is terminal-overrides option?
 * x What is prefix2? Can I use it to easily address windows > 9?
   * x A: Sadly, No. It's just an alias for prefix, so can't behave differently :(
 * x Why does X clipboard not work across ssh when DISPLAY is right?
   * x Used eval to set DISPLAY within the run-shell.
 * x ^a m, ^a M Quick mouse-mode toggle (not needed?): http://tangledhelix.com/blog/2012/07/16/tmux-and-mouse-mode/
 * vim + tmux integration: http://thedrearlight.com/blog/tmux-vim.html
 * vim: folding via grep
 * vim: Get rid of ^a.  Maybe make it equiv to ^w, for pane switching similar to tmux?
 * x vim: Get mouse to work within terminal
   * x In tmux
   * x Through ssh?



Todo make macro for Nested sessions:
• Enter pass-through mode:
∘ un-binds all "non-escaped" bindings
∘ Changes the escape to ^e
∘ Adds a "PASS" tag to the status line (maybe left side?)
